The findings of this new report complement and expand upon a <a href=\"https://mhanational.org/sites/default/files/Work%20Health%20Survey%202019.pdf\">2019 study</a> that showed that supervisor communication and a company culture of safe and open communication are correlated with an employee\u2019s motivation, confidence, and pride.</p>\n<p>This report expanded upon that understanding, by conducting research that goes beyond those actively seeking mental health support - making clear that across both a help-seeking and non-help-seeking population, an organisational culture of safe and open communication and supervisor support and guidance are important for increasing employee engagement and well-being and creating an overall mentally healthy workplace for all employees. </p>\n<p>Across both populations:</p>\n<ul><li>Supervisor communication is correlated with safety in reporting ethical violations and areas for improvement in the workplace.</li>\n<li>Feeling comfortable to report dishonest or unfair practices was most correlated with pride (whether you would recommend your workplace to others).</li>\n<li>Among all employee well-being measures, pride was the most correlated with supervisor communication and a company culture of safe and open communication.</li>\n<li>People who are the most stressed also reported they were in companies where it was safer to remain silent about their personal problems.</li>\n</ul><p>Therefore, it is imperative that supervisors and other company leadership take action to create a culture of communication and support that will benefit not only those employees that may be seeking resources for their mental health, but every employee in the workplace. Doing so will ultimately improve overall operations. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe know that company culture and engagement can affect employees\u2019 confidence and satisfaction with their jobs,\u201d said Paul Gionfriddo, president and CEO of MHA. \u201cManagement should take note \u2013 when supervisors support and provide their employees with guidance, it creates a company culture where employees feel equipped and motivated to perform their job well.\u201d</p>\n<p>MHA\u2019s research is part of an ongoing commitment to uncover workplace disparities and addressing the psychological needs of the workforce. MHA seeks to explore factors in work environments that influence employee engagement, workplace stress, and mental health. The research results help inform programs that can be developed and guidance we can give companies to make all workplaces in America successful and healthy.</p>\n</div>"

And we need to put a premium on early identification and early intervention for everyone with mental health concerns. We must address these crises before tragedies strike\u2014and Governors play a critical role in accomplishing this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Governor Raimondo has worked closely with advocates, including MHA Rhode Island, in support of the <a href=\"https://riparity.org/\">Mental Health Parity Initiative</a>, and she signed an Executive Order that directs state agencies to expand access to treatment for people living with mental illness or substance use disorders, ensure parity between physical and mental health, and encourage people to seek treatment when needed. The three main goals outlined in the Governor's order are improved access to mental health treatment specialists; development of a plan to lower the costs of mental health treatment; and working to eliminate the stigma associated with mental illness.</p>\n<p>Arguing that as a matter of public policy, mental illnesses are the only chronic diseases or conditions that we wait until Stage 4 to treat \u2013 and then often inappropriately only through incarceration, MHA branded its B4Stage4 philosophy in 2014 as a means of treating mental health concerns as public health - not public safety - issues, and drawing attention to the need for early detection and early intervention to promote recovery and health, just as we do with other chronic diseases. MHA created the <em>B4Stage4 Leadership Award</em> in 2016 to highlight the important work of Governors around the country on these issues.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow is the time for leadership on this issue, and MHA is happy to see the Governor of Rhode Island walk the walk on mental health reform,\u201d concluded Gionfriddo. \u201cWe hope that every state prioritizes mental health, now and in the coming years\u2014our goal is to someday be able to give the MHA <em>B4Stage4 Leadership Award </em>to every single Governor in this country.\u201d</p>\n</div>"

Their formal partnership officially begins today at the Shot Show in Las Vegas, where they will be openly engaging with firearm industry representatives, gun owners, gun sellers, and those that use firearms professionally.</p>\n<p>MHA is is dedicated to addressing the needs of those living with mental illness and to promoting the overall mental health of all Americans. Much of MHA\u2019s work is guided by the Before Stage 4 (B4Stage4) philosophy \u2013 that mental health conditions should be treated long before they reach the most critical points. Like other conditions, MHA believes in the need to address symptoms early, identify the underlying issues, and plan an appropriate course of action on a path towards overall health. MHA is teaming up with WTTA, a new organization founded by several in the firearm industry whose mission is to reduce incidents of suicide by firearms; gun negligence through education and proactive programs that identify risks; raise awareness; and provide solutions to those who choose to own firearms responsibly and the public at large.</p>\n<p>While the large majority of people with a mental illness are never violent, suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the United States and 2nd among adolescents and young adults aged 10 to 24 years old. Each year, more than 40,000 people die by suicide in the United States. On average, that\u2019s 123 Americans each day. Many, many more people attempt suicide than complete it. In fact, 90 percent of those that attempt to kill themselves don\u2019t die, and they don\u2019t go on to die later by suicide. But means do matter. If someone is considering suicide, having access to a firearm greatly increases the chances of dying. Eighty-five percent of people who attempt suicide with a firearm do die.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe know we can\u2019t prevent every suicide attempt, but it\u2019s important that we put politics aside to provide information and resources to those who need it \u2013 wherever they are,\u201d said Debbie Plotnick, MHA Vice President of Mental Health and Systems Advocacy. \u201cThis campaign is not about taking individuals\u2019 guns away, and it is not a campaign that is saying guns are good or bad. It\u2019s about knowing the signs of depression and suicide \u2013 and working together in an effort to save lives. We want to let people know that if they or someone they love is suicidal, it\u2019s OK to ask for help.\u201d</p>\n<p>MHA and WTTA will work together in the following ways:</p>\n<ul><li>MHA and WTTA will conduct outreach to gun sellers and ranges throughout the country in an effort to provide suicide prevention resources to their employees and customers; and will create and distribute materials about the warning signs of depression and how to identify if someone is having suicidal thoughts.</li>\n<li>MHA\u2019s anonymous online screening program \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.mhascreening.org\">www.mhascreening.org</a> \u2013 is now also available through the WTTA website: <a href=\"https://screening.mentalhealthamerica.net/screening-tools?ref=WTTA\">bit.ly/WTTAScreen</a>.</li>\n<li>MHA and WTTA will develop a certification program that will allow sellers and gun range owners and staff to have knowledge about mental health conditions and warning signs of suicide \u2013 and give them the tools to know what to do if they encounter someone who may be suicidal.\u00a0</li>\n</ul><p>\"Working with MHA is crucial to WTTA's success, said Mike Sodini, founder of WTTA. \u201cWhen we stand together, we are stronger. We are at epidemic levels of suicide in this country, and existing stigma and blame are getting in the way of real talk about depression, suicide and guns. It\u2019s time to work together to find real solutions to the problem of suicide.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>MHA Contact: Erin Wallace, 571-319-9594, <a href=\"mailto:ewallace@mentalhealthamerica.net\">ewallace@mentalhealthamerica.net</a><br /><br />\n\tWTTA Contact: Mike Sodini, 702-600-2700,\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:mikesodini@gmail.com\" target=\"_blank\">mikesodini@gmail.com</a></em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n</div>"

Prevention, early identification and intervention are essential to recovery.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is past time that we begin to act before crises occur, to prevent them and the horrible sadness they invariably leave in their wake.</p>\n<p>\u201cMental Health America will continue to work for prevention and early intervention services, for integration, for peer-to-peer services, and for all services leading to recovery; for protection of the essential mental health benefits people need; for parity protections; and for choices in care, services, and supports for people with mental health concerns. We sincerely hope that all of our public officials will do the same - and act before they talk.</p>\n<p>\u201cMHA also encourages people to use our Online Screening Program and Screening 2 Support (S2S) resources (<a href=\"http://www.MHAScreening.org\">www.MHAScreening.org</a>) to find help and support. If you or someone you love is feeling overwhelmed by what has happened and needs someone to talk to, please call 1-800-273-TALK (8255) or text MHA to 741-741.</p>\n<p>\"In the coming days and weeks, we hope that we will gain insight into why this kind of violence occurs - seemingly with no reason - and why we seem to be experiencing these violent acts with increasing frequency. Thoughts and prayers are not enough \u2013we have to find ways to prevent these events from occurring.\"</p>\n</div>"

This year, Minnesota came out on top overall with Nevada coming in 51st. The report also dives into addressing trauma in youth, and its long-term impact on performance and behavior in school.</p>\n<p>In developing the report, MHA looked at 15 different measures to determine the rankings. MHA hopes to provide a snapshot of mental health status among youth and adults for policy and program planning, analysis, and evaluation; to track changes in prevalence of mental health issues and access to mental health care; to understand how changes in national data reflect the impact of legislation and policies; and to increase the dialogues and improve outcomes for individuals and families with mental health needs.</p>\n<p>While much of the state of our mental health care continues to be broken, there are glimmers of hope. Since the release of its first report, MHA is seeing small yet encouraging decreases in the number of American adults who have mental health concerns (from 18.19% to 18.07%) and substance use problems (from 8.76% to 7.93%). Yet overall, the picture is still quite bleak.</p>\n<p>\u201cSadly, our report shows that there have been alarming increases in adult suicidal thoughts and major depression in youth,\u201d said Paul Gionfriddo, president and CEO, Mental Health America. \u201cDespite mental health being something that more and more people are talking about - far too many people are still suffering. People are simply not receiving the treatment they need to live healthy and productive lives - and too many don\u2019t see a way out.\u201d</p>\n<p>The estimated number of adults with serious suicidal thoughts is over 9.8 million \u2013 an increase of 200,000 people since last year. Over 2 million young people cope with severe major depression. And that is just the population that has been diagnosed. On average, it takes 10 years between the onset of symptoms and when individuals receive treatment. Over 24 million individuals experiencing a mental health illness are going untreated.</p>\n<p>MHA\u2019s report also shines the spotlight on childhood trauma and its impact long-term, and releases data that shows how much trauma can impact youth in school. Trauma-impacted youth are more likely to be absent from school, find themselves removed from classrooms, or struggle with academics. As part of MHA\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.mhascreening.org\">Online Screening Program</a>, in 2015 MHA offered an anonymous youth screen, the Pediatric Symptoms Checklist (PSC).</p>\n<p>Since the PSC has been offered, 116,683 youth have been screened and 569 self-selected to identify themselves as trauma survivors. Of those who self-described:</p>\n<ul><li>67% of screeners stated they often have trouble concentrating in school.</li>\n<li>73% reported the often felt sad or unhappy, with 64% reporting they often felt hopeless.</li>\n<li>58% stated they had experienced trouble with their teachers, and the same percentage reported they had engaged in fights with other children.</li>\n<li>66% reported they often felt irritable or angry.</li>\n<li>Of those who identified as trauma survivors, 94% also scored positive for PTSD; 68% screened positive for Severe Depression; 96% screened at-risk for psychosis, and 63% screened positive for Bipolar.</li>\n<li>43% of youth who identified as trauma survivors were not receiving mental health treatment or support, with 40% stating they had never received any mental health treatment or support.</li>\n</ul><p>MHA strongly supports integrating mental health services into the education system. Mental health interventions have show to shorten episodes of mental health conditions and prevent the development of more severe conditions, and schools can play a critical part by implementing trauma-informed programs that have been shown to help students who have been impacted by trauma.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOur children are crying out for help,\u201d concluded Gionfriddo. \u201cWe must continue to improve access to care and treatments, and we need to put a premium on early identification and early intervention for everyone with mental health concerns. We must address these mental health concerns before crisis and tragedy strikes\u2014before Stage 4.\u201d</p>\n</div>"
